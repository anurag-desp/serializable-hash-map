# Serializable Hash Map
This was a problem given to me in the coding assessment of a company I applied to. It was quite an interesting problem. I also liked how different it was from a generic interview question. I really enjoyed solving it and thought I should probably share my solution.

**Time Given**: `4 hrs`

**My Remarks**: It was more of a design question in my opinion. It tests whether you're able to make sense out of a problem that involves multiple parts where some have a local effect while some have a global effect on your over all design. Once you figure out the design aspect of it and manage to make sense of the decisions made in the algorithm, the problem becomes pretty easy and I'd say really fun to implement. I look forward to seeing these types of problems in interviews. I think this will be fun for both the candidate as well as the interviewer.

**Contribution**: If you are able to come up with even better, smarter, or more elegant solution, please please please make a pull request or maybe just share. I'd love to see some new perspectives on this problem and learn new patterns.
